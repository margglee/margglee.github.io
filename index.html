      <h2>Michigan Weather App</h2>
      <h5>Made my first app!, Sept 8, 2019</h5>
      <div class="postBanner"><img src="images/weatherAppPic.png" alt= "Picture of the app"></div>
      <p>I made my first app after doing an Android workshop about sensors.
        Using that knowledge, I applied it to my parody weather app. Since Michigan natives
         always joke about the rapidly changing weather, I wanted an app that captures the
          unpredictability. My app randomly choses one of the five weather statuses and
          each weather icon does a different action. Some statuses use sensors but every page
          is a lot of fun!

      <h2>Taylor Swift Lyrics Analysis</h2>
      <h5>Interesting Swift Lyrics Information, Aug 27, 2019</h5>
      <p>For my Coursera capstone project, I scraped the web for Swift's lyrics using Python and <a href="https://margglee.github.io/lyricsAnalysisTS/">visualized</a> it using JavaScript.
        Ignoring stop words and other words that I determined to not hold much meaning, I found that in every
        album, "know" is in the top 10 words used. I found this to be interesting because it's not a word I
       would associate with Swift, but looking back, she does declare that someone ought to "know" something
        often. Another interesting fact is that she never uses any variation of "woman" in her songs, even in her
         newest album, released at age 30. She still uses variations of "girl", so it seems that she has not grown up yet.
         Variations of "boy" and "man" are used throughout every album.</p>

      <h2>Hello World!</h2>
      <h5>Introduction, May 20, 2019</h5>
      <p>Hello! This is going to be my portfolio/blog. After taking a few coursera courses
         on web development, I made my personal website with CSS and HTML on my university's site.
        However, I feel like I should have my work somewhere else where I have more flexibility. Also, this summer,
        I made my first discord bot, a simple bot that reads messages and replies.</p>
